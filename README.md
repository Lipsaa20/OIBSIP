OIBSIP TASK-2 (GFG.java) :

The following repository is made for illustrating my task done given by Oasis Infobyte during my internship. 

A "Guess the Number" Game is a game where the computer will choose any random number between 1 and 120 (depends on the user), and you have to guess that number. Every time you choose a number, the computer will tell you whether your guess is higher or lower than the number selected by the computer. Well, keep in mind that you only get six tries to guess the number. At the end of the game, it will tell you what number was chosen by the computer.
